carry = 

9-3-2
2-3

add 9 and 2 and carry = 11, which is greater than 9
take 10 from this result, giving me 1, and make carry = 1
make new node with value of 1

move to next 
add 3 + 3 + carry = 7, which is less than or equal to 9, so
make carry = 0
make new node with val 7, make it next of the previous node

move to next
since one of the nodes is null, just make a new node with the value of the existing current node + carry and make it next of previous node 

note: at the end two possibilites: both null or one is null

def add_lists(list1, list2):
	if not list1:
		return list2
	if not list2:
		return list1

	carry = 0

	#initialize sumlist
	first_val = list1.val + list2.val 
	if first_val > 9:
		first_val -= 10
		carry = 1
	sumlist = Node(first_val)
	sumrunner = sumlist
	list1 = list1.next
	list2 = list2.next

	while list1 is not None or list2 is not None:
		if list1 is None:
			sumrunner.next = Node(list2.val + carry)
			return sumlist
		if list2 is None:
			sumrunner.next = Node(list1.val + carry)
			return sumlist

		val = list1.val + list2.val + carry
		if val > 9:
			val -= 10
			carry = 1
